# The Main Header
## R Markdown
### The second header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed **plots**, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to *prevent* printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Testing to see if Hello, world is printed

Here I am testing to see if Hello, world is printed without the inline code printed too.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
print("Hello, world.")
```
